# LABORATORY - MODULARIZATION WORKSHOP WITH VIRTUALIZATION AND INTRODUCTION TO DOCKER AND AWS. ðŸš€

## Escuela Colombiana de IngenierÃ­a - Enterprise Architectures(AREP).

_In this lab create a small web application using the Spark java micro-framework, also create a container for docker (to be used with the aforementioned application), where you deploy and configure both locally. Then in a repository that I created in DockerHub I uploaded the image so that finally in a virtual machine that I created in AWS (where we previously installed Docker) I could deploy my container._
